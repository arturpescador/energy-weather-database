The observed sudden and tremendous increases in river stages in a 2\\u20133 hour timeframe were more characteristic of flash flooding in small streams than expected behavior from main stem rivers. A rainfall maximum of over 18 inches was recorded in the Catskills. In addition to the widespread and significant flooding, tropical storm force winds took down many trees and resulted in nearly one million people without power, some for up to a week. Several towns in Vermont and in the Catskill Mountains in southeast New York were entirely isolated and eventually received airlifted disaster supplies until roadways were made passable again. Interstate 88 in New York was closed from Exit 22 to 24 from 28 August 2011 through 31 August 2011 due to flooding concerns, including evaluation of a bridge affected by high water (later deemed to be safe). Portions of Interstate 87 southbound (New York State Thruway) were closed on 28 August 2011 for flooding as well as for downed trees and power lines.\",",
